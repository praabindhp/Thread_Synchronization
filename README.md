# Thread_Synchronization
Java Program For Thread Synchronization

Thread synchronization is the concurrent execution of two or more threads that share critical resources. Threads should be synchronized to avoid critical resource use conflicts. Otherwise, conflicts may arise when parallel-running threads attempt to modify a common variable at the same time.

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
