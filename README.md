# Thread_Synchronization
Java Program For Thread Synchronization

Thread synchronization is the concurrent execution of two or more threads that share critical resources. Threads should be synchronized to avoid critical resource use conflicts. Otherwise, conflicts may arise when parallel-running threads attempt to modify a common variable at the same time.

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

This Is A Java Program Illustrating The Thread Synchronization & Its Processes

Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource. Java Synchronization is better option where we want to allow only one thread to access the shared resource.

Mechanism which ensures that two or more concurrent processes or threads do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment known as critical section. Processes' access to critical section is controlled by using synchronization techniques.
